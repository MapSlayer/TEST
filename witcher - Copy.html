<h1> The magnificent map of <i><u> Northern Realms</u> </i> from <u>Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</u></h1>
	
<h2><i> A brief description about the history &amp; origin of the content: </i></h2>

<style="text-align:justify:">
The Northern Kingdoms, also referred to as the Northern Realms or
simply the Four Kingdoms, were a group of human states north of the
Amell mountain range, the latter separating it from the Nilfgaardian
Empire in the south. The Nilfgaardians commonly referred to their
inhabitants as Nordlings within the Empire's core region and throughout
the conquered provinces. Aside from humans, many dwarves, elves,
gnomes, and halflings lived in the Northern Kingdoms as second-class
citizens. The Northern Kingdoms were invaded and partially conquered by
the Nilfgaardian Empire during the Northern Wars. Amidst the Third
Northern War, the only remaining sovereign monarch of the four major
kingdoms was King Radovid V of Redania. As a result, the Northern
Realms collectively became known as Radovid's Realms.</style="text-align:justify:"></p>
